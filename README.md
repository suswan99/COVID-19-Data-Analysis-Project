# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Project

Through analyzing datasets of hospital resources against growing cases of coronavirus per
county in the United State, we wanted to assess if hospitals have enough resources to treat the
growing number COVID-19 patients. Specifically, we want to understand: what are the “current”
hotspots of COVID-19 cases, do the amount of deaths in each county have an even ratio to the
number of total cases in the same area, and does the amount of hospitals/ICU beds in each state
impact the ratio of total cases to deaths in each state. We predict the percentage of deaths to
cases will decrease with the number of hospitals and ICU beds available per county increases.

The data tables, graphs, and visualizations created can be found on Jupyter Notebook can be found here: https://data100.datahub.berkeley.edu/user/susanzhang/notebooks/sp20/proj/proj3/Proj3%20Covid-19.ipynb .

The datasets, full report,.ipynb file can also be found in this repository. Three datasets were used abridged_counties.csv, time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv, and time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv .
